I am applying for Developer Mode on X as a free user to power experimentation, research, and community-focused event guide features I maintain. My intention is to keep reliance on X data modest, on-demand, and transparent, never amplifying disinformation or targeting sensitive categories. I will use the API primarily to understand public trend signals and to surface timely context for local activations such as meetups, pop-up shows, and cultural highlights.

The first use case is trend discovery: I plan to query the trends/place endpoint for broad regions to see which hashtags, topics, or creators are resonating with communities in Ghana and the wider West African diaspora. Those aggregated trends help me annotate event recommendations and write brief "what's buzzing now" notes on the site without storing the underlying raw tweets. The second use case is keyword exploration: when visitors search for themes like "music", "design", or "innovation", I will cross-reference those queries with the most recent public mention counts to indicate whether the subject is experiencing uplift. The third use case is analytics: I want to compare week-over-week momentum for categories I already curate, relying on the metadata timestamps rather than downloading complete tweet payloads.

Throughout these workflows I will obey X's Developer Agreement, including respecting rate limits, honoring user privacy, and retaining only what is essential. I will not repurpose data for advertising or facial recognition; my service exists to connect people with creators and experiences, so data protection and transparency are top priorities. I document usage carefully.
